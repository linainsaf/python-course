## How does SQL work?
SQL works by interacting with relational databases, which are databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. Here's how it works:

- To modify data in a database, users use SQL to update or delete rows in the tables.
- To query data from a database, users use SQL to retrieve specific data based on specified conditions.


SQL is a powerful language that can be used to manipulate and analyze data in many different ways. With SQL, users can manage and analyze data in a flexible and scalable way, making it a useful tool for businesses, organizations, and individuals.
